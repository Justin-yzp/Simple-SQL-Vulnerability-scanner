# SQL Injection Vulnerability Tester

## Overview

Welcome to the SQL Injection Vulnerability Tester! This Python script is designed to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications by scanning for forms and testing them with common SQL injection payloads. The project is crucial for assessing the security of web applications and ensuring they are protected against SQL injection attacks—a critical component of any comprehensive security assessment.

## Features

- **Form Detection**: Automatically detects all forms on a given URL.
- **Form Details Extraction**: Retrieves essential information about each form, including action URL, method (GET or POST), and input fields.
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Tests each form with common SQL injection payloads and checks for vulnerabilities.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for different types of SQL injection payloads and error messages.

## How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Form Detection**: Scrapes the given URL to identify all forms present.
2. **Form Details Extraction**: Extracts details such as action URL, method, and input fields from each form.
3. **SQL Injection Testing**: Submits test payloads to the forms and analyzes responses for signs of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
4. **Vulnerability Reporting**: Reports findings, indicating whether SQL injection vulnerabilities were detected.

## Functions

### `get_forms(url)`

- **Description**: Retrieves all the forms present on the given URL.
- **Parameters**: `url` - The target URL to scrape.
- **Returns**: A list of BeautifulSoup form objects found on the page.

### `form_details(form)`

- **Description**: Extracts and returns details about a specific form.
- **Parameters**: `form` - A BeautifulSoup form object.

### `vulnerable(response)`

- **Description**: Analyzes the HTTP response to determine if it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Parameters**: `response` - The HTTP response object.
- **Returns**: `True` if an SQL injection vulnerability is detected; otherwise, `False`.

### `sql_injection(url)`

- **Description**: Scans the given URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities by testing detected forms with payloads.
